# Go URL Shortener

A URL shortening service built with Go, evolving from a CLI tool to a full-featured web application.

## Overview

This project is my journey learning Go, following a structured 4-week learning plan. The application will grow incrementally from a simple command-line tool to a production-ready web service with user management, analytics, and API access.

## Development Roadmap

### Week 1: CLI Tool

- Basic URL shortening functionality
- Local JSON storage
- Command-line interface

### Week 2: Web Application

- HTTP server implementation
- Simple web interface
- Concurrent request handling
- Basic rate limiting

### Week 3: Enhanced Features

- SQLite database integration
- Click analytics
- Custom URL support
- Comprehensive testing

### Week 4: Production Features

- User accounts and authentication
- Dockerized deployment
- Logging and monitoring
- Performance optimization

## Tech Stack
